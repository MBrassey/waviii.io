#### Whitepaper

waviii Token has a fixed exchange rate of 1/100 with ETH. The total supply is 1 million waviii. I created waviii.io, the waviii ERC-20 [Token](https://github.com/MBrassey/waviii-token), [Wallet](https://github.com/MBrassey/wavWallet) and waviii to ETH [Swap](https://github.com/MBrassey/wavSwap) as decentralized application portfolio projects for prospective employers to review. The immediate goal of the waviii Token is to be a reference utility crypto-currency used within the waviii.io decentralized application ecosystem. The broader objective of the waviii Token is to establish itself as the crypto-currency of choice for anyone in the industry fulfilling a task with a smart contract. Over time, through adding new dApps to waviii.io, we intend to capitalize on a trend that is growing exponentially in our industry: the decentralisation of tasks around the globe and the use of smart contracts to fulfil them. We see the waviii Token as an opportunity for anyone - even the under-banked, the underserved, or the next wave of 4 billion individuals who are getting access to the internet – to find useful incentives for their work and improve their financial condition through access to a new decentralised financial system built upon the Ethereum Network.
